# Word-Search-Terminal

This is meant to be a word search game that you can run directly from the Linux CLI. You can either use your own word lists, or make use of the included ones.

## Prerequisites

To run the .jar file, you must have at least the JRE installed.

## Usage

To run this program, download the runnable .jar file from the latest release, and run the following:
`java -jar ws.jar <path>/<to>/<words>/<file> # Runs the program with a custom words file. Words must be 1 per line.`
Or, if you have a file named words.txt in the working directory:
`java -jar ws.jar # Runs the program with default words.txt`

## Running the program from anywhere on the system

If you want to run the program from anywhere on your system, download the file named word-search from either the repository or the latest release. Then, follow the instructions in word-search.
